# Bopomofo mode data sources

The bopomofo word lists (`frontend/static/languages/bopomofo*.json`) are the
most frequent phrases of McBopomofo's `phrase.occ`, with readings from its
`BPMFMappings.txt` (https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofo, `Source/Data`).
Those readings were originally derived from the `tsi.src` of libtabe. The
lists were filtered and annotated with the tooling described in the pull
request that added them.

Most bopomofo quotes (`frontend/static/quotes/bopomofo.json`, those whose
source reads "Tatoeba #id") are sentences from Tatoeba (https://tatoeba.org),
licensed under CC BY 2.0 FR
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/fr/). They were selected as
Taiwan-style traditional Chinese, their half-width punctuation was made
full-width, bopomofo readings were added, and a typo in #1698990 was fixed
(過去的是難過 → 過去的事難過); each keeps its Tatoeba sentence
number so the original can be found at https://tatoeba.org/sentences/show/<id>.
